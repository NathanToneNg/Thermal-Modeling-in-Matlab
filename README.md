A Thermal Modeling program written in Matlab.

The GUI is initially accessed with overallGUI. This function will reset all variables to defaults, so if you want to change only a few variables, use chooseSettings1. 

The parameters can be viewed using printParameters, and individual programs with variables set can be run in the Thermal*Ind functions. 

Other programs with _check and exp are various checks that the program works as predicted in basic cases, checking that total energy/temperature remains constant when no energy should be lost, and that there is exponential decay.
